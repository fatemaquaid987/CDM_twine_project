# INSTRUCTIONS

This document is meant to guide you in structuring your group experience through a written project proposal. You should work on this together in class, updating further as needed.

1. To start, **copy this document into a new GitHub repository**, to which all members of your group are invited as collaborators. (You can add collaborators on the Settings tab.)

2. Guiding questions are below. Working together, add your answers in the appropriate sections, and feel free to add further new sections as appropriate to your project.

3. Use git clone, push, and pull (and, if you're working separately at the same time, [pull requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4)) to stay up to date with the official version of this document.


## The team
_Who is working on this project?_

* Natasha K
* Fatema Q
* Rachel W



## The pitch
_What's the basic pitch for the project? e.g. What kind of thing are you making? Does it have a genre within that overall category? Who is the audience? What are your starting premises?_

We are making an interactive visual-based narrative on Twine that within the horror/thriller genre, based on an escape room (for now). 
Most essentially, the player gets stuck inside a house that they have to escape from. 



## The strategy
### ... overall
_What overall mode of collaboration are you planning to use: divide the work by project sections? by media types and expertise? by compromise and consensus all the way through? (See_ Writer/Designer _pages 113-114.)_

We're mostly breaking it down based on skill set, like so:
Natasha: visual + art, maybe animation?
Fatema: HTML/CSS and working with Twine programming
Rachel: Narrative + any odds/ends with visual and art

### ... in particular
_Now add some specificity to that general plan: who will take what role, at what points? How will you communicate with each other?_

We're mostly planning everything on Google Docs (I think we're going to have one doc for narrative-related stuff, one for code, 
and maybe more depending on how extensive this gets). We've exchanged phone numbers so we can communicate outside of class. 


## The calendar
_You may not be able to pin down dates until you get into the mix and see what's easy and what's harder than expected. But because our time for this unit is limited – we have only until the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, and I'm guessing you'd prefer to finish before going on break – it's important to set goals you can update as you know more. So, for now, what are you trying to finish..._
